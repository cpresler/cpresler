## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Christy!


I'm a Design Engineer that is passionate about user-centered design, building scalable and accessible applications with design systems, and continuously learning through mentoring others.

### 5 Reasons to Add Me to Your Team

1. I build scalable, mobile-first applications that optimize user experience, technical performance, and business goals.

2. I design and build with the user in mind â€” great software starts with understanding people and the issues they are facing.

3. I speak the languages of design and development â€” and I'm happy to help you get your teams collaborating well across disciplines.
    - And I build tooling to support collaboration where it is happening (I co-authored [FigLog](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/FigLog) - a Figma widget for logging changes in design systems)

5. I make teams better â€” my creative problem solving extends to my relationships with my teammates and I do the work necessary to make teams into collaborative units that produce top-notch results.

6. I like challenges and I enjoy learning new things.
